The Wholesome Table website project using node.js server

<br />
<br />

This is a project website made using node.js server. As of now, this cannot be run full since a folder that holds all the modules installed with the node server cannot be uploaded since most of the files, especially the folder, starts with a dot, which github reads as a hidden file and cannot be upload.

I'm uploading the bare html/ejs only as of this moment.
